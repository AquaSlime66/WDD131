			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>One of my favorite shows is <i>Breaking Bad</i>, and something I like to do for CSE class projects is make something that relates to me or my interests. Los Pollos Hermanos is a well-known resturant in the world of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, so it would make sense for them to have some system of online ordering, an online menu or even just a website. The resturant is actually a front for some more illict/illegal activities, and that's where the javascript will come in (I will not be doing anything illegal...).</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The likely audience for this is fans of the TV shows <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Better Call Saul</i>. I've enjoyed these shows over the past couple years with several family members and friends, so they are another target audience. The resturant owner, Gustavo Fring, also references a website with a complaint form, so that's an additional page I will add.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The home page will be a resturant menu, with all resturant items added dynamically through javascript. A secret menu with references to miscellaneous scenes and such in <i>Breaking Bad</i> appears in place of the menu items when a secret password is used in some location (still figuring that out). I might also add some sort of cart, where the user can add items from the menu to their cart, and see them once they click on it. If that still isn't enough Javascript, the complaint form will definitely use some to hide user details or important information.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
				target="_blank"
				> https://color.adobe.com/r-theme_los-pollos-hermanos-breaking-bad-tv-show-color-theme-16815624/</a
			>
			<p>This is one of the palletes I found, but I didn't just copy it, I used a variety of different colors from different but related sites. </p>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Background Color</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#9f1000]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#021F59]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#05C7F2]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#fccc00]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->
			<p>The way this site plan's css is structured doesn't fit well with my color pallete; it's pretty inaccesible and hard to read right now, but that will be fixed on the actual site.</p>
			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: JI Burrito
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Josefin Sans
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
				velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
				occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
				mollit anim id est laborum.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod

			</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>

			<h2>Content</h2>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The original menu will be detailed descriptions of each item availible for purchase,
				and a hidden (kind of) button will then switch it over to a menu of memorable Breaking
				Bad scenes or something similar (all added through javascript)

            </p>
			<img src="image-storage/wireframe-home.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Complaint/Email Referral System</h3>
			<p>
				The user can go here to submit a complaint, if they wish. The page has a complaint
				or suggestion form for the user, and displays messages based on what they input. It also
				features branding and guarentees from the corporate Pollos. I may also let the user choose to submit
				a suggestion or a complaint, form and based on that choice, the form with dynamically change, also
				via Javascript.
			</p>

			<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
			<p>I got some of my ideas and color schemes from other people that've done similar
				projects, but the menu system (with it's switch) I'm implementing is significantly different then the others,
				along with the email complaint form, mentioned in the show. Here is every other site that I 
				referenced from, if just a little.
